# This constains extensions which shall be gitignored
#
# This file should be symliked at the root of the source codes (.tex, .md)
# so that if users use editor which compile in place, the generated files
# will be ignored. For example:
#
#    git-root/src/.gitignore            ( -> ../submodule/THIS_FILENAME )
#    git-root/submodule/THIS_FILENAME
#
# This cannot be symliked from the repo root, since it is possible for example
# that users have media .pdf files for which they do not hold the source
# and which they want to include into their projects
